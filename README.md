# ParKing

Description: This service would let users rent out their parking spot when itâ€™s not being used. Therefore, when users are out of town, they would rent out their parking spot for a certain period of time and would choose their own rate. On the other hand, users looking to rent would be able to see a map of their local area with the available parking spots and their associated rates. Then, the user could rent a spot of their choice for a specified period of time. Essentially, our project is AirBnB for parking.
