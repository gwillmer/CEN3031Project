# CEN3031Project

Project name: ParKing

Project description: This service would let users rent out their parking spot when itâ€™s not being used. So when users are out of town, they would rent out their parking spot for a certain period of time and would choose their own rate. From a user POV: they would go to a map of their local area and see all available parking spots on a map with their associated rates. Then the user could rent a spot of their choice for a period of time.
